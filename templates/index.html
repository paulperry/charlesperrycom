<p>Charles O. Perry (1929-2011) was a sculptor, designer, and
architect.  His intuitive investigation of nature's variables provides
the springboard for many of his concepts.  Believing that sculpture
must stand on its own merit without need of explanation, Perry's work
has an elegance of form that masks the mathematical and scientific
complexity of its genesis.  He has lectured on mathematics and art in
conferences throughout the world. </p>

<p>Charles Perry's sculptures have been commissioned for public spaces
in the United States, Australia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and
in private collections throughout the world.</p>

<p>As an industrial designer, Charles Perry has invented and patented
three unique prize winning chairs. He has designed other objects of
art such as a collection of jewelry and silver for Tiffany, chess
sets, and puzzles.</p>
