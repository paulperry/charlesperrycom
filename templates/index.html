<h3>The Charles O. Perry Fund</h3>(FAAR’66, RAAR’71)

<p>This fund is in memory of American sculptor, architect and designer
Charles Perry. In 1964 Charlie won the Rome Prize in Architecture at
the <a style="color:yellow; text-decoration: underline;"
href="http://aarome.org/membership-and-giving.php#ways26"
target="_donate">American Academy in Rome</a>, writing “…I want to
gain greater perspective, the perspective of other places, other
times, philosophies, cultures and economics…Architecture is not
written, it is built; not a picture, an environment. I want to draw
from the knowledge of Europe, to do so I must be there, see it, smell
it, hear it, live it…”</p>

<p>And so he did in what proved to be a pivotal point in his life and
career. At the Academy, he began to pursue seriously his sculpture
career which consisted of more than 100 works created over 45
years.</p>

<p>The Charles O. Perry Fund will help provide this opportunity for other
artists with similar determination, intelligence and grace.</p>

<p>Charles O. Perry (1929-2011) was a sculptor, designer, and
architect.  His intuitive investigation of nature's variables provides
the springboard for many of his concepts.  Believing that sculpture
must stand on its own merit without need of explanation, Perry's work
has an elegance of form that masks the mathematical and scientific
complexity of its genesis.  He has lectured on mathematics and art in
conferences throughout the world. </p>

<p>Charles Perry's sculptures have been commissioned for public spaces
in the United States, Australia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and
in private collections throughout the world.</p>

<p>As an industrial designer, Charles Perry has invented and patented
three unique prize winning chairs. He has designed other objects of
art such as a collection of jewelry and silver for Tiffany, chess
sets, and puzzles.
